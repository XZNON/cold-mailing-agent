Tired of the repetitive grind of sending cold emails for job applications? I was too. As a developer, I decided to tackle this problem head-on by building a tool to automate the entire process.

This project is an AI-powered agent that takes a list of recruiters and your resume, then crafts and sends personalized emails tailored to the job role you're targeting. It's designed to save time, reduce the hassle of the job hunt, and let you focus on what matters most: preparing for interviews.

And because staring at a loading screen is no fun, I added a Whack-a-Mole minigame to play while the agent works its magic!

‚ú® Features

    Automated Emailing: Sends emails to a list of recruiters from an Excel file.

    AI-Powered Content: Uses LangChain to generate a professional summary of your resume and craft a unique email body for each application.

    Personalization: Tailors the content based on the recipient's name, company, and the job role you provide.

    Automatic Resume Attachment: Includes your resume as an attachment with every email.

    Interactive Frontend: A simple, clean user interface built with React to manage the process.

    Engaging UI: Play a fun Whack-a-Mole game while your emails are being sent!
